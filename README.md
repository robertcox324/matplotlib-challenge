Robert Cox's week 5 matplotlib HW

Conclusions: 
1) A heavier mouse will, on average, have a larger tumor than a smaller mouse.
2) Capomulin and Ramicane seem to be the most promising drug regimen overall, both consistently showing a decrease in tumor volume and smaller tumors on average by the end of the regimen. They are also the drug regimen with the highest total data points
3) the gender distribution of mice tested was very close to 50/50, so the data was not skewed to one gender or another
